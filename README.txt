BMI Calculator
==============

Storyboard
----------
While this is technically a Universal app, all storyboard-ing was done for the
iPhone.

Coding style
------------
- There are no custom objects being used.
- Everything is handled inside the ViewController.
- There are no tests.

Graphics
--------
I created a set of images of a pizza with various numbers of slices missing. The
smaller your BMI, the more slices are shown. Exporting and creating these images
probably took ~50% of the time.
